# Pokémon Species Data

JavaScript/TypeScript library containing Pokémon species and form metadata.

All species information has been compiled from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and this library would not exist without the research done by those teams.
